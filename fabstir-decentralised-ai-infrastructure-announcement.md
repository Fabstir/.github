## Why Businesses Need More Options

Today's AI landscape offers limited choices, with a few major providers setting the terms. Here's what enterprises are telling us they need:

- **Data Sovereignty**: Keep valuable business insights and customer data under your complete control
- **Predictable Costs**: Transparent pricing without surprise bills or unexpected rate limits
- **Compliance Clarity**: Know exactly where your data is processed and stored
- **Innovation Freedom**: Build whatever your business needs without platform restrictions
- **True Ownership**: Own your infrastructure investment, not just rent temporary access

**Our Philosophy**: Competition drives innovation and value. Fabstir is expanding the market by offering a decentralised alternative.

## Fabstir's Four-Pillar Solution

### 1. Enhanced S5 Storage: Your Data, Your Control âœ… COMPLETE

Through our Sia Foundation grant (completed in record time), we've enhanced the S5 protocol to create sovereign data storage:

**Business Benefits**:
- **Guaranteed Availability**: Sia's blockchain network ensures your data remains accessible through cryptographic contracts
- **Enhanced Encryption**: XChaCha20-Poly1305, a modern, high-speed cipher with long nonces for strong security and large-scale data
- **Enterprise Performance**: Matches leading cloud providers' speed at up to 90% lower storage cost

**In Plain English**: Your data becomes virtually indestructible whilst remaining completely under your controlâ€”no trust required.

### 2. AI Vector Database: Your Proprietary Knowledge Base âœ… OPERATIONAL

Vector databases store your company's unique knowledgeâ€”the custom training that makes AI work for YOUR specific business.

**Our Approach**:
- **Zero-Knowledge Security**: Your data is encrypted before leaving your premisesâ€”we can't see it, nobody can
- **Universal Compatibility**: Works seamlessly with any language model
- **Audit-Ready**: Blockchain records provide immutable compliance documentation
- **Complete IP Protection**: Your competitive advantages stay yours alone

**Real Example**: A law firm can store thousands of case precedents in our vector database. Their AI drafts contracts using their specific expertise, without exposing client data to any third party.

### 3. Decentralised LLM Marketplace: The Free Market Advantage ðŸš§ BETA SEPTEMBER 2025

Creating a true marketplace where thousands of providers compete to serve you better.

**Current Capabilities**:
- P2P network operational with automatic job routing
- Real-time inference with GGUF models (tiny-vicuna, llama-3.2, more coming)
- Smart contract staking and reputation system deployed
- 250+ tokens/second on consumer GPUs (RTX 4090)

**How It Works**:
1. **Open Participation**: Anyone with compute power can become a providerâ€”fostering innovation
2. **Market Competition**: Natural price discovery through supply and demand
3. **Quality Assurance**: Providers stake 1000 FAB tokensâ€”automated systems ensure service quality
4. **Instant Settlement**: Smart contracts handle payments transparently and immediately
5. **Your Choice**: Select providers based on your specific needsâ€”price, location, specialisation

**The Opportunity**: We're democratising AI infrastructure, creating opportunities for providers and significant savings for users through competition.

### 4. AI-Enabled Application Store: Innovation Without Barriers (Coming Q1 2026)

A decentralised app store for applications that leverage AI and blockchain capabilities.

**For Businesses**:
- **Compliance Ready**: Built-in audit trails and data sovereignty features
- **Seamless Integration**: Applications work together through open standards
- **Fair Pricing**: Usage-based costs with complete transparency

**For Developers**:
- **Open Platform**: No arbitrary approval processes
- **Fair Economics**: Keep your revenue without platform taxes
- **Collaborative Ecosystem**: Share capabilities securely between applications
- **Global Reach**: Deploy once, available everywhere

## Real-World Applications

### Financial Services: Protecting Competitive Edge
**Challenge**: Investment firms need AI analysis without exposing proprietary strategies.

**Fabstir Approach**: Trading algorithms remain encrypted in your vector database. Processing happens on distributed nodes using cryptographic proofs. Complete regulatory audit trails. Typical savings: 70-90% versus traditional solutions.

### Healthcare: Privacy-First AI
**Solution**: Patient data stays within hospital control. AI models process data locally. Multiple institutions can collaborate on research without sharing raw data. Full HIPAA compliance architecture.

### Legal: Confidentiality Guaranteed
**Capability**: Process sensitive documents with complete confidentiality. Zero-knowledge architecture ensures absolute privacy. Blockchain provides court-admissible audit trails.

### Government: Secure AI Infrastructure
**Features**: Deploy within secure facilities. No external dependencies. Complete data containment. Enterprise-grade AI capabilities.
